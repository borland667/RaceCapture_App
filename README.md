RaceCapture App
===============

App for the RaceCapture series of motorsport telemetry systems.

## Dependencies
See requirements.txt for full list of requirements

## dev installation (OS X)

1. Install kivy 1.9.1 via pip 
- > Instructions: https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-osx.html
1. install [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org)
1. create a virtual environment (perhaps in this directory): `virtualenv _ve`
1. activate the virtualenv: `. _ve/bin/activate`
1. install pip requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (you may be required to upgrade your version of setuptools via the provided command)
1. install asl_f4_loader in dependencies folder: pip install asl_f4_loader-X.X.X.tar.gz
1. install pygame (http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml - use correct package for your OSX+Python version)

## Simplified dev install (OS X)
1. Install kivy 1.9.1 via pip 
- > Instructions: https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-osx.html
1. install Kivy into Applications and run symlink script
1. install [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org)
1. re-enable setup tools for Kivy virtualenv: `sudo virtualenv /Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/venv/`
1. install pip requirements: `/Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. run app: `kivy main.py`

## running (OS X)

    /Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/script main.py


## Building releases (all platforms)
1. Add a .sentry file with the app's platform-specific DSN for Sentry
1. Follow the platform-specific build instructions

## Preparing to build installers (OSX)

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed inside Kivy's venv 
1. `cd /Applications/Kivy.app/Contents/Resources/venv/bin` && `source activate`
1. `cd /path/to/RaceCapture_App` && `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. If we're using a custom build of Kivy, we need to fix the paths for some libraries, run the install/osx/fix-osx-paths.sh script.


## Creating installer for current version (OSX)
1. `cd install/osx`
1. `./build-osx.sh`

The script will create the .App file and .dmg for distribution.

## installation (Win7)

1. Install kivy via pip - instructions https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html
1. Install [virtualenv]: `pip install virtualenv`
1. Create a virtual environment (perhaps in this directory): `virtualenv _ve`
1. Activate the virtualenv: `_ve\Scripts\activate`
1. Install pip requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if this crashes you installed the py3.3 version of Kivy, doughball)

## running (Win7)

    Launch kivy environment by launching kivy-2.7.bat in installation folder
    Navigate to the RaceCapture source directory
    kivy main.py
	Note: If you get an error doing this ("cannot find text provider") then you might be like me and be unable to run RaceCapture inside a virtualenv for some reason. Try performing the above steps without the virtual env part.

## dev installation (Eclipse on Win7, but probably applies to Eclipse on any platform)

1. Do the "installation" instructions above
1. Download [Eclipse] (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
1. Install [PyDev for Eclipse] (http://pydev.org/manual_101_install.html) and use auto-config
1. In Window..Preferences..PyDev..Interpreter..Python Interpreter..Environment, add a variable "PATH" with value c:\kivy;c:\kivy\Python;c:\kivy\gstreamer\bin;c:\kivy\MinGW\bin;%PATH%
1. In Window..Preferences..PyDev..Interpreter..Python Interpreter..Forced Builtins, add "kivy" to the list
1. Make a new project in Eclipse, select "PyDev project" and specify the folder with Racecapture in it
1. Right-click the project...Properties...pyDev-PYTHONPATH...External Libraries - Add source folder, add my_kivy_install_folder\kivy
1. Run the project

## Preparing to build installers (Win7)

1. `kivy` (to get paths set up)
1. activate the virtualenv: `_ve\Scripts\activate`
1. Install [PYInstaller] (http://www.pyinstaller.org) `pip install pyinstaller`
1. Install [PyWin32] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/) `pip install pywin`
1. Try `pyinstaller --version` - should return "2.1" or similar
1. Install [nullsoft scriptable install system] (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download) stable version (currently 2.46)
1. Open (from your Kivy folder) `\Python27\Lib\site-packages\pygments\lexers\__init__.py` and add a line "from pygments.lexers.agile import PythonLexer" near the top. Yes, I know this is bad form. It's to fix an error ("AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'PythonLexer'") where PyInstaller failed to find an import and I couldn't work out how to force it. You would think that this could be forced by creating a hook-pygments.lexers.py file with hiddenimports = ['agile'] in it, but you'd be wrong as this file already exists in the default PyInstaller hooks and it doesn't fix this problem. -CLR 2014-05-29

## Creating installer for current version (Win7)

1. Go into RaceCapture_App folder
1. Activate the virtualenv: `_ve\Scripts\activate`
1. `kivy` (to get paths set up)
1. cd install
1. `buildwininstall.bat` - deletes old build folders, builds installer and tries to run the package (to run manually use `dist\racecapture\racecapture`)

## dev installation (Linux - Ubuntu)

1. Install kivy 1.9.1 via pip
1. install [virtualenv]: `sudo pip install virtualenv`
1. create a virtual environment (perhaps in this directory): `virtualenv _ve`
1. activate the virtualenv: `. _ve/bin/activate`
1. install pip requirements: `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` (you may be required to upgrade your version of setuptools via the provided command)
1. install asl_f4_loader in dependencies folder: pip install asl_f4_loader-X.X.X.tar.gz

## running (Linux - Ubuntu)

    python main.py

## Buildozer android APK build/install (Linux only)

1. install buildozer from https://github.com/kivy/buildozer
1. from the root RaceCapture app directory, run ./build_apk.sh . buildozer will download files as necessary and build the apk
1. if buildozer fails with a cython error, install cython from your package manager
1. if buildozer fails with an Android SDK error, enter the ~/.buildozer directoy and run android update sdk -u from the android tools directory.

## Launch android apk
1. Ensure your android device is in developer mode and plug it in via usb
1. install / launch the app using ./launch_apk.sh
1. Console / debug output will appear on screen as app is downloaded, installed and run
